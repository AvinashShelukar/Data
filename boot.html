      <p style="color:rgb(240, 240, 240);" >Indian opener Rohit Sharma played his 200th One Day International against New Zealand in Hamilton on January 31, 2019. He scored 7806 runs at an average of 47.88 with 22 hundred and 39 half-centuries in his ODI career till now. What these numbers don’t reveal is that this right-handed batsman has clearly two phases in his limited-overs career. These two chapters of Rohit’s ODI career are so distinctively different that it is unfair to certify him based on his overall statistics.</p>

      <h2></h2>
      <b><h5>Rohit Sharma</h5></b>
      
      <p style="color:rgb(240, 240, 240);">Since his ODI debut in 2007 to the beginning of Champions Trophy in 2013, Rohit Sharma scored 1978 runs as a middle-order batsman at an average of 30.43. The talented batter had only two hundreds and 12 fifties with a highest score of 114 till his 86th matches. Then it was 2013 Champions Trophy and India was searching for a replacement of Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag. The then Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni played a masterstroke and moved Rohit Sharma up to the batting order. He made Rohit an opener alongside Shikhar Dhawan. There began the process of reincarnation for Rohit Sharma as an ODI legend and India found their consistent, dependable opening bat in the limited overs.</p>
      
      <h2 class="mt-5"></h2>
      <h5></h5>
      
      <p style="color:rgb(240, 240, 240);">He has been a competent captain in ODI. Even his batting record as a captain is highly impressive. Rohit led the team from the front in the nine matches he captained by scoring 541 runs in 9 matches at an average of 90.16 with two centuries and two half-centuries. One of his double hundreds also came during his captaincy. So very rightly in his 200th ODI, he was given the opportunity to captain the side. Unfortunately, it ended with a loss. But this is only his second loss as an ODI captain. Rohit Sharma certainly can be termed as a good limited overs skipper. This claim is well supported by his captaincy record in Twenty 20 Internationals and IPL.</p>
